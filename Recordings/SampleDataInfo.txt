We wanted to add some sample data to this branch so users could get a sense of what the output of LLAMAS looks like. 
Unfortunately the files are too large to upload to Github, so we have uploaded them to figShare instead. please see them here:

https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22110872.v1

Note that this still only contains downsampled (200Hz) recordings from inside the scanner, as the data exceeded the 20GB limit.
2 sample 5000hz recording have been included as well.
